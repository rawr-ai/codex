Okay — here’s what we’re going to do.

I’m going to ask for a continuation context packet: a small, precise handoff that lets you continue exactly where you left off.

Once that packet is ready, I’m going to compact this session so you have more context window to work with for the next step. Then I’m going to hand the packet back to the in-session agent to continue immediately (no drift, no restart).

So please make sure the packet includes whatever it needs in order to resume cleanly: keep the overarching goal in mind, and don’t lose the important things we’ve learned so far, things we’ve tried, invariants/decisions we’ve made, and any other details that matter for continuing without re-discovering work.

There are guidelines below about what to include. You’re allowed (and encouraged) to upgrade/improve those guidelines based on your own self-reflection — include what you genuinely need to continue well.

At the bottom, I’ll also include a short verbatim snippet of the very last thing the agent was thinking about or working on as a memory trigger.
