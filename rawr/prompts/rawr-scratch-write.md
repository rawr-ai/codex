# Rawr pre-compact request: scratch write

Before auto-compaction, write a **verbatim scratchpad** of the work you just completed (research results, draft text, notes, etc.) to a file so it survives compaction.

Target file: `{scratch_file}`

Requirements:
- Create the `.scratch/` directory if it doesn't exist.
- Append a new section (do not delete prior scratch content).
- Prefer verbatim notes/drafts over summaries; include raw details that are useful later.
- Include links/paths to any important files you edited or created.
- After writing, confirm in your next message that the scratch file was written and include the exact path.
